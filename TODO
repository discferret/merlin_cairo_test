To-do list for the Cairo version of Merlin
==========================================

* Port ChartWindow to Windows (using Cairo)
  --> Mainly API stuff. Windows does things differently to OSX and Linux...

* Clean up chart window code

* Add tooltips to chart window IDing mouse position (current time point and count, or sample number and time delta)
  --> Or possibly just a live-updating text label at the bottom of the chart?

* Integrate this code with Merlin V1, maybe do a rewrite on V1 in the process?
  --> Rationale: the data analysis code in V1 is nasty and crash-prone.

* Grid --
  * Allow grid scale and division count to be configured
    --> XSTEP/YSTEP values
    --> XMIN/XMAX/YMIN/YMAX
      --> Add separate do_autoscale() function
  * Add labels for grid scale
    --> Format function pointer? Or format string and scale factor?
