To-do list for the Cairo version of Merlin
==========================================

* Port ChartWindow to Windows (using Cairo)
* Clean up chart window code
* Add tooltips to chart window IDing mouse position (current time point and count, or sample number and time delta)
* Add grid text to chart window
* Integrate this code with Merlin V1, maybe do a rewrite on V1 in the process?
    Rationale: the data analysis code in V1 is nasty and crash-prone.
* Allow autoscale to be disabled
* Properly handle out-of-range data
* Grid --
  * Allow grid scale and division count to be configured
  * Properly align zero-line and gridlines with incoming data
  * Add labels for grid scale
